# Big-O-
Big O notation is what allows us to measure the idea of scalable code.

This repository offers a quick description of the Big-O of many example functions implemented in both JavaScript and Java

O(n) --> Linear Time 

- As our number of items increase our number of opeartions increase as well linearly

What factors contribute to O(n) [linear time]?
  
-for loops, while loops through n items


O(1) --> Constant Time 

- It doesn't matter how many inputs we have, it's always going to run the same, this code is very scalable

What factors contribute to O(1) [constant time]?

â€“ no loops, variable assignation
